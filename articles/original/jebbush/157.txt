Mark J. Terrill/AP                  The third GOP debate was a heavyweight match but with quick footwork and well-orchestrated jabs that were responded to with masterful cross-counters. The surprise? Trump wasn't the only one punching. Bush went after Rubio for missing Senate votes. Kasich said Trump's platform was "fantasy." In a recurring theme, Cruz attacked the media and the CNBC moderator. Carson, who's been rising in the polls, stayed above the fray. The candidates also staked out real positions: Cruz vowed to eliminate the IRS. Trump called gun-free zones "a catastrophe." Carson proposed a cut to all government subsidies. Here are the three must-watch bouts:               Jeb Bush to Marco Rubio: "You should be showing up to work ... or just resign, and let someone else take the job." https://t.co/BcfVUI9N9Bâ€” MSNBC (@MSNBC) October 29, 2015                                                   That's the quickie version of what happened in the third Republican presidential debate of the 2016 race Wednesday night.
