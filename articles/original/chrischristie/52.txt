      Best Twitter Reactions To McCarthy Withdrawing From Speaker Race                                        Updated October 8, 20154:46 PM ET                    Originally published October 8, 20154:04 PM ET                                                                                                                                                            Jessica Taylor                           Twitter                                                                                                             Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., joked on Twitter that things weren't going very "smooth" for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. — unlike his own scrumptious fruit smoothie.                                                Twitter                                       House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was supposed to win the GOP leadership election to succeed retiring House Speaker John Boehner easily. Wrong.   Faced with a conservative revolt and an inability to win over his caucus, McCarthy made a stunning announcement Thursday that he was withdrawing from the race.   Democrats rejoiced in the ensuing chaos. There was reportedly crying in the halls of Congress. And 2016 contenders even offered up their thoughts on successors.   Here are some of the best reactions.   Longtime Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., may have won the Internet when he posted his reaction to learning about McCarthy's withdrawal. You see, he was just making himself a healthful fruit smoothie when he made the obvious connection between his afternoon beverage and the predicament House GOP leaders found themselves in.

Mark Sanford, R-S.C., also had his priorities when it came to food.               Some members crying as #KevinMcCarthy drops out.

Peter King, R-N.Y., told him about the emotions inside the room. And we don't think he was talking about the clothing store.               Rep. Peter King tells me that members are crying in cloakroom, unable to handle the unrest and confusion. "A banana republic," he says.— Robert Costa (@costareports) October 8, 2015         This one was pretty much the reaction in the NPR newsroom, too.               The White House press file just straight up erupted into cries of "WHAT?????"— Byron Tau (@ByronTau) October 8, 2015         Winter is coming, House Republicans.               #DearDC, It’s a joke down there. https://t.co/Zp4Q5uSdsF— Chris Christie (@ChrisChristie) October 8, 2015         If not Donald Trump for speaker, then Trump's daughter for speaker.               "@Moonwkr: @realDonaldTrump I would like to nominate @IvankaTrump for Speaker of the House" What a great idea, she is a total winner! (Nice)— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2015         Chris Matthews never disappoints with the very, um, vivid imagery.               The great @hardball_chris on McCarthy news "This is news, this is big, this is toilet overflowing in the carnival line big!"— Luke Russert (@LukeRussert) October 8, 2015         Meanwhile, Democrats are trolling hard.               Nancy Pelosi for speaker.— DCCC (@dccc) October 8, 2015      Copyright 2015 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.
