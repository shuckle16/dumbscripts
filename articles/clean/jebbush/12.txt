democrats   doubt like  attribute  large dr growth gap  macroeconomic policy choices   data   support   claim  write  seems  must look instead  several variables   mostly good luck  perhaps  touch  good policy    democrats  write  presided  better productivity shocks  think improvements  technology  boost  economy like  internet boom  better international conditions  better consumer expectations
