But As Part Of The Gag                                       Updated November 8, 201510:25 AM ET                    Originally published November 8, 20159:34 AM ET                                                                                                                                       Eyder Peralta                           Twitter                                                                                                             Demonstrators march to protest Donald Trump's views on Latinos hours before he hosts "Saturday Night Live," on Saturday in New York.                                                Katie Park/AP                  Saturday Night Live acknowledged a group of protesters outside of its studios with a bit of comedy last night.   As we've reported, Latino activists had called on NBC to disinvite Donald Trump from hosting the late-night comedy show. They charged that Trump had shown himself to be a bigot when he denigrated Mexican immigrants.   In the past, NBC reacted to those comments by dropping him as host of Celebrity Apprentice and dropping Trump's Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants.   But last night, Trump took the stage as planned. And NBC planted comedian Larry David to heckle him:               Larry David couldn't miss this opportunity. #SNL

On Twitter, the group said David had won the bounty:               Larry David wins $5,000  https://t.co/PcIfWXCmnT "bounty" for calling Trump a RACIST on SNL. Joke or not, it's true. #RacismIsntFunny #Win— Deport Racism (@DeportRacism) November 8, 2015      Copyright 2015 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.
