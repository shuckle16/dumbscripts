balanced   miller walking outside realizing  small    sounds like something     sounds like something    negative thought like oh   small none   matters   actually    like  weight lift  freedom like

worthless   kelley    younger generation   muhammad well      mean   voice   kelley ok just making sure   miller yeah   millennials         younger generation millennials   kelley technically   miller ok  take   know  see     guess  hard speaking  absolutes   everyone feels   guess  people   know     even just talking  artists just people  general  just     openmindness  like  worlds   fingertipstype thinking   see  people now  want  make  website   like selfexpression  want    blog  want  give  world  thoughts    therapeutic thing   everyone  think now feels like  voice means something     putting  everywhere people put  voice everywhere   instagram comments  minuscule  kind  stupid       time  dope people really feel like    say something   sometimes  little much  like go ahead man speak away   kelley   think     coincidence    q  earl  hit  level  development around    time   miller well   believe  coincidence really   like ooooh      mean  think everybody hanging   playing music  making music  creating together     beautiful thing   affected everybody    think    just look  everyone   make  sound old  everyone   time   muhammad  can take    miller     type  things like   native tongues    people   just around    pushing   whether    studio together   afar     friends  now  everyones touring   like   threeway call    thebe put something   q put something   like ok alright  want     friendly kind  pushing    happy      good thing     think   coincidence  think  world needed   else    happened  guess   kelley  needed    miller hey  needed     muhammad   two years    away cause  say  back  creating  record     definite vision   time away   wanted  attack  reach   miller  think    difficult thing     find   wanted  vision      moments   just wanted  go  far left right  like really far   rabbit hole  make  album   just really weird  weird   sake   weird  weird   sense    played    everyday person   really get  right   kelley     sound like   miller   just    heard  heard  records          really musical    storytelling    heavier little   mean  songs  sadder    just telling maybe sadder stories   kelley maybe alonetype stuff   miller right  insular   album ended   something   think resonates  little bit   first listen   lot      wanted  perform   wanted   able  throw  album   everyone jump around   one   like  seated performance  know   yeah   think  just took      comfortable      artistically get  album   quality    ok   going  musical  deep   storytelling    lot   really almost orchestral things  like yeah quality  can ok  one  getting  one   next quality takes  little longer   muhammad  think  albums dope  mean  like   music   heard  definitely hope     know   going     miller  will come    muhammad  played    things actually    like  working  three albums  one time    like  brain   hurting   miller  know   muhammad   get   moments   just like  start  project   like yup just another project  people  like      like yo  heads    three pieces   different  well    space    just really impressed   way   working  put things together   lyrically  mentioned   couple different places   record   alone   one really caring   secondthirdperson    firstperson   miller  probably  mix      think    guess   fear    release music   one hears    release music     move anybody  think   fear    think    fear  making  album    much   work    making      forgot    making music  touch people    think    mind state  created     like  making  album    making  album      get   point   time  put  together   realize        purpose  bigger    yeah  think   part   fear  everything   kelley    know   purpose  bigger     miller  just  two reasons one just  connecting  fans   think probably  coolest thing  music  ever done   like
