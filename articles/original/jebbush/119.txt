But the Vermont independent who is running for the Democratic nomination for president didn't stop there.               Live-tweeting the debate starting now. #DebateWithBernie pic.twitter.com/iQFf3dj7Hb— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015         The septuagenarian senator live tweeted the debate, with help from his 24-year-old digital director. That is, until just shy of 10:30 p.m., when he called it quits.               Does anyone know... when will this debate finally end? #DebateWithBernie— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015                     Thank you all. I've had it. I'm going home. Talk to you soon. #DebateWithBernie— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015         It all seemed to be a hit with his fans. His tweets got tens of thousands of retweets and favorites. According to Twitter, Sanders had two of the three most retweeted candidate posts of the night, exceeded only by Jeb Bush's "Sorry Mom" tweet in reference to youthful smoking of marijuana. This is similar to the last debate where a Sanders quip was the most retweeted.   Other candidates had teams of staff doing rapid response, but Sanders was his own rapid-response unit. Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs said the candidate offered quips and observations while watching the debate. Kenneth Pennington, the campaign's digital director, sat next to Sanders on a sofa, typing and tweeting the senator's often-sarcastic thoughts on a laptop.   In no particular order, here are the top 10 #DebateWithBernie tweets:   Before the debate began, Sanders asked in a tweet whether the candidates would discuss "serious issues," and he spent much of the debate wondering when they would get to the issues he considers most pressing.               Have you heard anyone use the word "poverty" yet? 47.7 million Americans living in poverty. No discussion. #DebateWithBernie— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015                     Waiting, waiting, waiting. Will we hear anything about racial justice, income inequality or making college affordable? #DebateWithBernie— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015         Twitter really needs to develop a sarcasm font.               Trump. What a pleasant and humble person. Can't stop saying kind and generous things about his fellow Republicans. #DebateWithBernie— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015                     Yup. Bush was a great president. Yes. No doubt. Great president. All Obama's fault. #DebateWithBernie— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015         The debate was held at the Reagan Library, and the 40th president was invoked frequently, which gave Sanders an idea.               Okay. Let's vote for Reagan. Sounds better than any of these guys. #DebateWithBernie #GOPDebate— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015         The GOP candidates were largely in agreement on Planned Parenthood. (They think it should lose its federal funding). Sanders doesn't agree.               Does anyone on that stage believe the women of this country have the right to control their own bodies? Anyone? #DebateWithBernie— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015                     Trump: "I will take care of women." Really? What about respecting the right of women to control their own bodies? #DebateWithBernie— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015                     Rich get richer. Everyone else gets poorer. And all these guys can talk about is war and defunding Planned Parenthood. #DebateWithBernie— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015         Sanders got impatient with the focus on war.               Can these guys talk about anything other than their desire to go to war? #DebateWithBernie— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015                     War, war, war. When do we get to their other major priority: tax breaks for billionaires? #DebateWithBernie— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 17, 2015         But Sanders tuned out too soon. Debate moderator Jake Tapper, citing questions coming in from social media, asked the candidates about climate change.   Alas, Sanders' Twitter account remained silent for the rest of the debate.Copyright 2015 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.
